## Development

Credits go to the contributors of cabal-node, react-native, react-navigation, react-native-gifted-chat, and nodejs-mobile.

First make sure you follow the official React Native docs to setup your local environment with the necessary compilers for Android and/or iOS. Then, git clone this project, and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Also install dependencies in the backend project:

```bash
cd nodejs-assets/nodejs-project
npm install
```

Then run

```bash
react-native run-android
```

If things go wrong, try rebuilding the backend:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
react-native run-android
```
